classdef robotKinematicModel < handle
    %robotKinematicModel A convenience class for storing robot physical 
    % and performing related kinematic transforms. You can reference the
    % defined constants via the clas name with robotKinematicModel.W2 for
    % example because they are constant properties and therefore associated
    % with the class rather than any instance. Similiarly, the kinematics
    % routines are referenced from the class name as well.
